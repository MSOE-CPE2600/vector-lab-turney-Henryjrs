The purpose of this assignment is to create a vector calculator program that can store up to 10 vectors.
This project will also add two features to the vector calculator program.
The ability to load and save vectors to and from files, and the ability to store “unlimited” vectors
through the use of dynamic memory.

The program is able to upload csv files and store them in vectors via:
load_vectors_csv & save_vectors_csv functions in the VectorCalc.h - header and VectorMem.c - source files.

Lab Report:
After a few changes to update me Lab 5 errors (individual vector assignments, uppercase/lowercase separation), and then
the additional VectorMem functions and definitions were added. After way too much time trying load up a csv file, I
finally got one to upload, but duplicates are NOT being acknowledged...
The program continuously loads the data from the CSV file or TXT, but it only overwrites the vector, not acknowledge
the strcmp are equal (...and I'm usually pretty good with error messages thx to java training, smh).
As of submission, this program is mostly functional, but I will submit and come back to this with more updates in
the near future...
